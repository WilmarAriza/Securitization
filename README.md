New project to value a Mortgage-backed Security using the Montecarlo Simulation in Python

Monte Carlo simulation is a management science/operations research technique  that  is  commonly  employed  in  fi  nance.  The  purpose  of  Monte Carlo simulation is to generate a probability distribution for the outcome of some random variable of interest. In its application to valuing securities, it is used to generate interest rate paths so that potential cash fl ows on those paths can be determined and then each path is valued. (In the parlance of simulation, an interest rate path is referred to as a trial.) The value for the security on each of those in-terest rate paths is then one value in determining the estimated prob-ability distribution for the securityâ€™s value.
